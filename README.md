# Catalog App
I have developed an application that creates a Catalog based on Categories and Products in it. Users can log in by Google or Facebook in order to create or modify information on the App, users can only modify information added by them.

## Setup:
* ##### Install Vagrant and virtual box
    Can be found at [Vagrant](vagrantup.com) and [Virtual Box](virtualbox.org)
* ##### Launch the Vagrant VM
    Command *vagrant up*
* ##### Login to your vagrant environment
    Command *vagrant ssh*

# How to run Catalog App
vagrant@vagrant:/$ *cd /vagrant/catalog*
vagrant@vagrant:/$ *python catalog.py*

Access and test Catalog App by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally
